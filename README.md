## 📌 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Hospital Management System (AI-HMS)** is a modular, intelligent healthcare information system designed to automate hospital workflows and provide **AI-assisted decision support** for medical staff.  
The system integrates **machine learning models**, **role-based access control**, **analytics dashboards**, and an **AI chatbot interface** to enhance hospital efficiency and interpretability of clinical data.

This project is developed as a **400-level, multi-semester undergraduate capstone project**, focusing on system architecture, data integrity, and responsible AI integration rather than UI complexity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate hospital administrative workflows
- Maintain structured and secure patient records
- Assist doctors with AI-based patient risk analysis
- Provide analytics for hospital management
- Improve system usability through an AI chatbot
- Demonstrate scalable and modular system design

## 🔐 User Roles & Access Control

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Admin | User management, analytics, system overview |
| Doctor | Patient records, diagnosis, AI insights |
| Receptionist | Patient registration, appointment scheduling |

Role-based authorization ensures data security and accountability.

---

## 📂 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Patient Management
- Patient registration and updates
- Medical history tracking
- Visit records and clinical notes
- Secure relational data storage

---

### 2️⃣ Appointment & Queue Management
- Appointment scheduling
- Conflict detection
- Doctor-wise patient queues
- Appointment lifecycle management

---

### 3️⃣ Medical Records Module
- Diagnosis records
- Prescriptions
- Test recommendations
- Longitudinal patient data analysis

---

### 4️⃣ AI-Based Decision Support System
The system includes a **machine learning module** that analyzes patient data to:
- Predict patient health risk levels (Low / Medium / High)
- Identify potential readmission risks
- Highlight high-risk patients for prioritization

The AI module is designed as a **decision support tool**, not a diagnostic replacement.

---

### 5️⃣ Analytics & Reporting Dashboard
- Daily patient statistics
- Doctor workload analysis
- High-risk patient monitoring
- Hospital utilization trends

---

### 6️⃣ AI Chatbot Assistant
A controlled, domain-restricted chatbot that:
- Explains AI predictions and analytics
- Summarizes patient histories
- Answers hospital workflow queries
- Enhances system interpretability

⚠️ The chatbot does **not provide medical diagnosis**.
